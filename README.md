# Iris Flower Species Classification

## Project Overview
This project utilizes classification algorithms to identify iris flower species based on petal and sepal measurements. It serves as a demonstration of practical machine learning using the widely known Iris dataset.

## Features
- Implements Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers
- Visualizes data with seaborn pairplot
- Provides confusion matrix and accuracy metrics
- Comprehensive, reproducible Jupyter notebook workflow

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
    cd iris-flower-classification
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```
    pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch the Jupyter notebook:
    ```
    jupyter notebook iris_classification.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the notebook steps to:
    - Load and explore the dataset
    - Visualize with seaborn pairplot
    - Train Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models
    - Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Results

- Seaborn pairplot visualizing dataset features and classes
- Accuracy scores for both classifiers
- Confusion matrices and detailed classification reports
